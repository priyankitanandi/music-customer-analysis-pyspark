A real-world big data analytics hands-on coding tutorial using PySpark. Also, it is loosely based on a past client project. 

Users are continuously connecting to the service and listening to tracks that they like -- this generates our main data set. The behaviors captured in these events, over time, represent the highest level of detail about actual behaviors of customers as they consume the service by listening to music. In addition to the events of listening to individual tracks, we have a few other data sets representing all the information we might normally have in such a service.
